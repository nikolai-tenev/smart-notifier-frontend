This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). If you're not familiar with that go over to their page and check it out. This way you can see how to start the project on your end.

This repo contains the front-end files for a very simple web app/tool, that aggregates job posts from different freelancing platforms into an auto refreshing list.

You can do what ever you want with it.

This project is developed by a [small software development agency called DigidWorks](https://digidworks.com/).
